# Coloured Trello Jira cards

User script for creating coloured cards and Jira links on Trello,
when the title starts with an issue number like XYZ-123.

User scripts can be run on Chrome using a third party browser extension
called [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/).

This is tested in 2013 version of Trello and may not work today. Sorry!
